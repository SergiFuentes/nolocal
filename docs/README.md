## What
This is a work in progress bot for discord servers. In the time writing this, the bot is only capable of two silly commands.

But it has a great infrastructure to create and deploy a bot in few steps! you can see de details in the full documentation.

The intention of this project is to create a layer of abstraction between multiple cloud providers to create game servers like minecraft by discord commands.

## Why
There are lots of users that don't know how to create game servers, and the ones who knows how it works will have to go through a complex process to create instances, open them to public, open ports and more.

With this solution, once it's configured on your favourite server, you can create instances and start/stop it as you use it, paying the server the time is being used.

## How
The users of this bot will have to configure their clouds accounts through the bot.

The bot will create, start and stop instances based on the commands. 

You can check out the full documentation in this site:
