## What
This is a work in progress bot for discord servers. In the time writing this, the bot is only capable of two silly commands.

The intention of this project is to create a layer of abstraction between multiple cloud providers to create game servers like minecraft by discord commands.

## Why
There are lots of users that don't know how to create game servers, and the ones who knows how it works will have to go through a complex process to create instances, open them to public, open ports and more.

With this solution, once it's configured on your favourite server, you can create instances and start/stop it as you use it, paying the server the time is being used.

## How
The users of this bot will have to configure their clouds accounts through the bot.

The bot will create, start and stop instances based on the commands.
